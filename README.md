# Interactive Character Sheet for Fallout: The Roleplaying Game

## Description
The Fallout: The Roleplaying Game character sheet web application is an interactive, digital recreation of the standard physical character sheets required to play the game. It allows users to enter and modify data dynamically and will automate calculations on behalf of the player where applicable. It also allows players to save the data they enter locally and loads the most recently saved data whenever the application is opened.

## Features
- **Digital Character Sheet:** Users will see a digital version of the Fallout: The Roleplaying Game character sheet, complete with fields for character statistics, equipment, and biography.
- **Data Entry:** Users can enter information into the applicationâ€™s data fields whenever they load it in their browser.
- **Data Modification:** Users can modify the information they have entered in the data fields at any time.
- **Data Validation:** The application validates user input and alerts them when their input is invalid. For example, it notifies users when string data is entered into a numerical field and vice versa.
- **Automatic Calculations:** The application automatically calculates data, such as the required number of experience points to reach the next level of character growth, whenever possible.
- **Data Saving:** Users can save the data entered into the character sheet by clicking a Save button, which confirms the action before saving.
- **Data Persistence:** The application automatically loads the most recently saved data into the character sheet fields whenever it is opened, ensuring users always have access to their latest data.
