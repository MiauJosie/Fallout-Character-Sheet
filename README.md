# Interactive Character Sheet for Fallout: The Roleplaying Game FORK

## Description
The Fallout: The Roleplaying Game character sheet web FORK application is an interactive, digital recreation of the standard physical character sheets required to play the game. It allows users to enter and modify data dynamically and will automate calculations on behalf of the player where applicable. It also allows players to save the data they enter locally and loads the most recently saved data whenever the application is opened.
